<h2>About</h2>

My project is a symptom tracker app that is calendar style so that you can moniter and share your symptoms with your care provider.

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

 My goals are to learn more about web design and building apps because I've only worked minimally with Java in Poole's class.
